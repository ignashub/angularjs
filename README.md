## Hera page!
http://i413957.hera.fhict.nl/

**Extra features**(these features were not requierd based on the WEB2 Practicals.pdf):
- Calender component.
- Local storage functionality.
- Ability to see employees belonging to a certain department in Departments component.
- Ability to see the department to which an employee belongs to in the Employees component.

**Issues:**
- The task employeesID array would not get populated on the API. Therefore I was not able to display the employees currently working on the task.
  However in the local storage the employeeID array of a task does get succesfully populated.
- There was another issue on the Hera server where if you would try to refresh a page it would return an error page. However we did manage to fix this issue.
